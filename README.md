NBA Shot Charts Dashboard
This Shiny dashboard provides an interactive way to visualize NBA players' shooting performance and shot distribution during the 2023-24 regular season. Users can explore individual players' shot charts, compare their performance to league averages, and view detailed statistics from different areas on the court.

Features:
Field Goal Percentage Heatmap: This chart shows how a selected player performs in different zones on the court compared to the league average. Red zones indicate above-average shooting, while blue zones indicate below-average performance.

Shot Density Chart: A comparison of where a player takes their shots in relation to other players in the league. Darker areas indicate that the player takes more shots from those locations compared to league averages.

Shooting Stats Table: A detailed table breaking down the player's shooting attempts, makes, and field goal percentages in different court zones, alongside the league average for comparison.

Data is sourced from nbastatR and hoopR packages, covering shots from all active NBA teams during the 2023-24 regular season.
